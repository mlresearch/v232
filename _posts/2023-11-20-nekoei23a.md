title: Dealing With Non-stationarity in Decentralized Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep
  Reinforcement Learning via Multi-Timescale Learning
abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL)
  can be a versatile learning framework, particularly in scenarios where centralized
  training is either not possible or not practical. One of the critical challenges
  in decentralized deep MARL is the non-stationarity of the learning environment when
  multiple agents are learning concurrently. A commonly used and efficient scheme
  for decentralized MARL is independent learning in which agents concurrently update
  their policies independently of each other. We first show that independent learning
  does not always converge, while sequential learning where agents update their policies
  one after another in a sequence is guaranteed to converge to an agent-by-agent optimal
  solution. In sequential learning, when one agent updates its policy, all other agent’s
  policies are kept fixed, alleviating the challenge of non-stationarity due to simultaneous
  updates in other agents’ policies. However, it can be slow because only one agent
  is learning at any time. Therefore it might also not always be practical. In this
  work, we propose a decentralized cooperative MARL algorithm based on multi-timescale
  learning. In multi-timescale learning, all agents learn simultaneously, but at different
  learning rates. In our proposed method, when one agent updates its policy, other
  agents are allowed to update their policies as well, but at a slower rate. This
  speeds up sequential learning, while also minimizing non-stationarity caused by
  other agents updating concurrently. Multi-timescale learning outperforms state-of-the-art
  decentralized learning methods on a set of challenging multi-agent cooperative tasks
  in the epymarl benchmark. This can be seen as a first step towards more general
  decentralized cooperative deep MARL methods based on multi-timescale learning.

title: 'RaSP: Relation-aware Semantic Prior for Weakly Supervised Incremental Segmentation'
abstract: Class-incremental semantic image segmentation assumes multiple model updates,
  each enriching the model to segment new categories. This is typically carried out
  by providing expensive pixel-level annotations to the training algorithm for all
  new objects, limiting the adoption of such methods in practical applications. Approaches
  that solely require image-level labels offer an attractive alternative, yet, such
  coarse annotations lack precise information about the location and boundary of the
  new objects. In this paper we argue that, since classes represent not just indices
  but semantic entities, the conceptual relationships between them can provide valuable
  information that should be leveraged. We propose a weakly supervised approach that
  exploits such semantic relations to transfer objectness prior from the previously
  learned classes into the new ones, complementing the supervisory signal from image-level
  labels. We validate our approach on a number of continual learning tasks, and show
  how even a simple pairwise interaction between classes can significantly improve
  the segmentation mask quality of both old and new classes. We show these conclusions
  still hold for longer and, hence, more realistic sequences of tasks and for a challenging
  few-shot scenario.

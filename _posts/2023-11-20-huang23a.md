title: 'Towards Single Source Domain Generalisation in Trajectory Prediction: A Motion
  Prior based Approach'
abstract: Trajectory prediction is an important task in many real-world applications.
  However, data-driven approaches typically suffer from dramatic performance degradation
  when applied to unseen environments due to the inevitable domain shift brought by
  changes in factors such as pedestrian walking speed, the geometry of the environment,
  etc. In particular, when a dataset does not contain sufficient samples to determine
  prediction rules, the trained model can easily consider some important features
  as domain variant. We propose a framework that integrates a simple motion prior
  with deep learning to achieve, for the first time, exceptional single-source domain
  generalisation for trajectory prediction, in which deep learning models are only
  trained using a single domain and then applied to multiple novel domains. Instead
  of predicting the exact future positions directly from the model, we first assign
  a constant velocity motion prior to each pedestrian and then learn a conditional
  trajectory prediction model to predict residuals to the motion prior using auxiliary
  information from the surrounding environment. This strategy combines deep learning
  models with knowledge priors to simultaneously simplify training and enhance generalisation,
  allowing the model to focus on disentangling data-driven spatio-temporal factors
  while not overfitting to individual motions. We also propose a novel Train-on-Best-Motion
  strategy that can alleviate the adverse effects of domain shift, brought on by changes
  in environment, by exploiting invariances inherent to the choice of motion prior.
  Experiments across multiple datasets of different domains demonstrate that our approach
  reduces the influence of domain shift and also generalizes better to unseen environments.

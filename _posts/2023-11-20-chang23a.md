title: Low-rank extended Kalman filtering for online learning of neural networks from
  streaming data
abstract: We propose an efficient online approximate Bayesian inference algorithm
  for estimating the parameters of a nonlinear function from a potentially non-stationary
  data stream. The method is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), but uses a
  novel low-rank plus diagonal decomposition of the posterior precision matrix, which
  gives a cost per step which is linear in the number of model parameters. In contrast
  to methods based on stochastic variational inference, our method is fully deterministic,
  and does not require step-size tuning. We show experimentally that this results
  in much faster (more sample efficient) learning, which results in more rapid adaptation
  to changing distributions, and faster accumulation of reward when used as part of
  a contextual bandit algorithm.

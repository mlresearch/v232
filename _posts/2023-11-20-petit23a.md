title: 'PlaStIL: Plastic and Stable Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning'
abstract: 'Plasticity and stability are needed in class-incremental learning in order
  to learn from new data while preserving past knowledge.  Due to catastrophic forgetting,
  finding a compromise between these two properties is particularly challenging when
  no memory buffer is available. Mainstream methods need to store two deep models
  since they integrate new classes using fine tuning with knowledge distillation from
  the previous incremental state.  We propose a method which has similar number of
  parameters but distributes them differently in order to find a better balance between
  plasticity and stability.  Following an approach already deployed by transfer-based
  incremental methods, we freeze the feature extractor after the initial state.  Classes
  in the oldest incremental states are trained with this frozen extractor to ensure
  stability.  Recent classes are predicted using partially fine-tuned models in order
  to introduce plasticity.  Our proposed plasticity layer can be incorporated to any
  transfer-based method designed for exemplar-free incremental learning, and we apply
  it to two such methods. Evaluation is done with three large-scale datasets. Results
  show that performance gains are obtained in all tested configurations compared to
  existing methods. '

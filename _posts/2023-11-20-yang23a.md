title: 'Partial Index Tracking: A Meta-Learning Approach'
abstract: Partial index tracking aims to cost effectively replicate the performance
  of a benchmark index by using a small number of assets. It is usually formulated
  as a regression problem, but solving it subject to real-world constraints is non-trivial.
  For example, the common $\ell_1$ regularised model for sparse regression (i.e.,
  LASSO) is not compatible with those constraints. In this work, we meta-learn a sparse
  asset selection and weighting strategy that subsequently enables effective partial
  index tracking by quadratic programming. In particular, we adopt an element-wise
  $\ell_1$ norm for sparse regularisation, and meta-learn the weight for each $\ell_1$
  term. Rather than meta-learning a fixed set of hyper-parameters, we meta-learn an
  inductive predictor for them based on market history, which allows generalisation
  over time, and even across markets. Experiments are conducted on four indices from
  different countries, and the empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our
  method over other baselines. The code is released at https://github.com/qmfin/MetaIndexTracker.

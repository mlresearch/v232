title: Minimal Value-Equivalent Partial Models for Scalable and Robust Planning in
  Lifelong Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Learning models of the environment from pure interaction is often considered
  an essential component of building lifelong reinforcement learning agents. However,
  the common practice in model-based reinforcement learning is to learn models that
  model every aspect of the agentâ€™s environment, regardless of whether they are important
  in coming up with optimal decisions or not. In this paper, we argue that such models
  are not particularly well-suited for performing scalable and robust planning in
  lifelong reinforcement learning scenarios and we propose new kinds of models that
  only model the relevant aspects of the environment, which we call \emph{minimal
  value-equivalent partial models}. After providing a formal definition for these
  models, we provide theoretical results demonstrating the scalability advantages
  of performing planning with such models and then perform experiments to empirically
  illustrate our theoretical results. Then, we provide some useful heuristics on how
  to learn these kinds of models with deep learning architectures and empirically
  demonstrate that models learned in such a way can allow for performing planning
  that is robust to distribution shifts and compounding model errors. Overall, both
  our theoretical and empirical results suggest that minimal value-equivalent partial
  models can provide significant benefits to performing scalable and robust planning
  in lifelong reinforcement learning scenarios. '

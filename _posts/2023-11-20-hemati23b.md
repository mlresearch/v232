title: Class-Incremental Learning with Repetition
abstract: Real-world data streams naturally include the repetition of previous concepts.
  From a Continual Learning (CL) perspective, repetition is a property of the environment
  and, unlike replay, cannot be controlled by the agent. Nowadays, the Class-Incremental
  (CI) scenario represents the leading test-bed for assessing and comparing CL strategies.
  This scenario type is very easy to use, but it never allows revisiting previously
  seen classes, thus completely neglecting the role of repetition. We focus on the
  family of Class-Incremental with Repetition (CIR) scenario, where repetition is
  embedded in the definition of the stream. We propose two stochastic stream generators
  that produce a wide range of CIR streams starting from a single dataset and a few
  interpretable control parameters. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation
  of repetition in CL by studying the behavior of existing CL strategies under different
  CIR streams. We then present a novel replay strategy that exploits repetition and
  counteracts the natural imbalance present in the stream. On both CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet,
  our strategy outperforms other replay approaches, which are not designed for environments
  with repetition.

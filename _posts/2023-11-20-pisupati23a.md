title: Human inductive biases for aversive continual learning — a hierarchical Bayesian
  nonparametric model
abstract: Humans and animals often display remarkable continual learning abilities,
  adapting quickly to changing environments while retaining, reusing, and accumulating
  old knowledge over a lifetime. Unfortunately, in environments with adverse outcomes,
  the inductive biases supporting such forms of learning can turn maladaptive, yielding
  persistent negative beliefs that are hard to extinguish, such as those prevalent
  in anxiety disorders. Here, we present and model human behavioral data from a fear-conditioning
  task with changing latent contexts, in which participants had to predict whether
  visual stimuli would be followed by an aversive scream. We show that participants’
  learning in our task spans three different regimes — with old knowledge either being
  updated, discarded (forgotten) or retained and reused in new contexts (remembered)
  by different participants. The latter regime corresponds to (maladaptive) spontaneous
  recovery of fear. We demonstrate using simulations that these behavioral regimes
  can be captured by varying inductive biases in Bayesian non-parametric models of
  contextual learning. In particular, we show that the “remembering" regime can be
  produced by “persistent" variants of hierarchical Dirichlet process priors over
  contexts and negatively biased “deterministic" beta distribution priors over outcomes.
  Such inductive biases correspond well to widely observed “core beliefs" that may
  have adaptive value in some lifelong-learning environments, at the cost of being
  maladaptive in other environments and tasks such as ours. Our work offers a tractable
  window into human inductive biases for continual learning algorithms, and could
  potentially help identify individual differences in learning strategies relevant
  for response to psychotherapy.

title: Active Class Selection for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning
abstract: For real-world applications, robots will need to continually learn in their
  environments through limited interactions with their users. Toward this, previous
  works in few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) and active class selection
  (ACS) have achieved promising results but were tested in constrained setups. Therefore,
  in this paper, we combine ideas from FSCIL and ACS to develop a novel framework
  that can allow an autonomous agent to continually learn new objects by asking its
  users to label only a few of the most informative objects in the environment. To
  this end, we build on a state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSCIL model and extend it with techniques
  from ACS literature. We term this model Few-shot Incremental Active class SeleCtiOn
  (FIASco). We further integrate a potential field-based navigation technique with
  our model to develop a complete framework that can allow an agent to process and
  reason on its sensory data through the FIASco model, navigate towards the most informative
  object in the environment, gather data about the object through its sensors and
  incrementally update the FIASco model. Experimental results on a simulated agent
  and a real robot show the significance of our approach for long-term real-world
  robotics applications.

title: Vision-Language Models as Success Detectors
abstract: 'Detecting successful behaviour is crucial for training intelligent agents.
  As such, generalisable reward models are a prerequisite for agents that can learn
  to generalise their behaviour. In this work we focus on developing robust success
  detectors that leverage large, pretrained vision-language models (Flamingo, Alayrac
  et al. (2022)) and human reward annotations. Concretely, we treat success detection
  as a visual question answering (VQA) problem, denoted SuccessVQA. We study three
  vastly different domains: (i) interactive language-conditioned agents in a simulated
  household, (ii) real world robotic manipulation, and (iii) “in-the-wild” human egocentric
  videos. We investigate the generalisation properties of a Flamingo-based success
  detection model across unseen language and visual changes in the first two domains,
  and find that the proposed method is able to outperform bespoke reward models in
  out-of-distribution test scenarios with either variation. In the last domain of
  “in-the-wild” human videos, we show that success detection on unseen real videos
  presents an even more challenging generalisation task warranting future work. We
  hope our results encourage further work in real world success detection and reward
  modelling with pretrained vision-language models.'

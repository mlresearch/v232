title: Auxiliary task discovery through generate-and-test
abstract: 'In this paper, we explore an approach to auxiliary task discovery in reinforcement
  learning based on ideas from representation learning. Auxiliary tasks tend to improve
  data efficiency by forcing the agent to learn auxiliary prediction and control objectives
  in addition to the main task of maximizing reward, and thus producing better representations.
  Typically these tasks are designed by people. Meta-learning offers a promising avenue
  for automatic task discovery; however, these methods are computationally expensive
  and challenging to tune in practice. In this paper, we explore a complementary approach
  to the auxiliary task discovery: continually generating new auxiliary tasks and
  preserving only those with high utility. We also introduce a new measure of auxiliary
  tasksâ€™ usefulness based on how useful the features induced by them are for the main
  task. Our discovery algorithm significantly outperforms random tasks and learning
  without auxiliary tasks across a suite of environments. '

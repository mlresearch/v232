title: Sample-Efficient Learning of Novel Visual Concepts
abstract: 'Despite the advances made in visual object recognition, state-of-the-art
  deep learning models struggle to effectively recognize novel objects in a few-shot
  setting where only a limited number of examples are provided. Unlike humans who
  excel at such tasks, these models often fail to leverage known relationships between
  entities in order to draw conclusions about such objects. In this work, we show
  that incorporating a symbolic knowledge graph into a state-of-the-art recognition
  model enables a new approach for effective few-shot classification. In our proposed
  neuro-symbolic architecture and training methodology, the knowledge graph is augmented
  with additional relationships extracted from a small set of examples, improving
  its ability to recognize novel objects by considering the presence of interconnected
  entities. Unlike existing few-shot classifiers, we show that this enables our model
  to incorporate not only objects but also abstract concepts and affordances. The
  existence of the knowledge graph also makes this approach amenable to interpretability
  through analysis of the relationships contained within it. We empirically show that
  our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art few-shot multi-label classification
  methods on the COCO dataset and evaluate the addition of abstract concepts and affordances
  on the Visual Genome dataset.  '

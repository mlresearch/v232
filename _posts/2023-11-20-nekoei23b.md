title: 'Towards Few-shot Coordination: Revisiting Ad-hoc Teamplay Challenge In the
  Game of Hanabi'
abstract: 'Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms with Zero-Shot
  Coordination (ZSC) have gained significant attention in recent years. ZSC refers
  to the ability of agents to coordinate with independently trained agents. While
  ZSC is crucial for cooperative MARL agents, it might not be possible for complex
  tasks and changing environments. Agents also need to adapt and improve their performance
  with minimal interaction with other agents. In this work, we show empirically that
  state-of-the-art ZSC algorithms have poor performance when paired with agents trained
  with different methods, and they require millions of samples to adapt to these new
  partners. To investigate this issue, we formally defined a framework based on a
  popular cooperative multi-agent game called Hanabi to evaluate the adaptability
  of MARL methods. In particular, we created a diverse set of pre-trained agents and
  defined a new metric called adaptation regret that measures the agentâ€™s ability
  to efficiently adapt and improve its coordination performance when paired with some
  held-out pool of partners on top of its ZSC performance. After evaluating several
  SOTA algorithms using our framework, our experiments reveal that naive Independent
  Q-Learning (IQL) agents in most cases adapt as quickly as the SOTA ZSC algorithm
  Off-Belief Learning (OBL). This finding raises an interesting research question:
  How to design MARL algorithms with high ZSC performance and capability of fast adaptation
  to unseen partners. As a first step, we studied the role of different hyper-parameters
  and design choices on the adaptability of current MARL algorithms. Our experiments
  show that two categories of hyper-parameters controlling the data diversity and
  optimization process have a significant impact on the adaptability of Hanabi agents.
  We hope this initial analysis will inspire more work on designing both general and
  adaptive MARL algorithms.'

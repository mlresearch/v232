title: Re-Weighted Softmax Cross-Entropy to Control Forgetting in Federated Learning
abstract: In Federated Learning a global model is learned by aggregating model updates
  computed at a set of independent client nodes. To reduce communication costs, multiple
  gradient steps are performed at each node prior to aggregation. A key challenge
  in this setting is data heterogeneity across clients resulting in differing local
  objectives. This can lead clients to overly minimize their own local objective consequently
  diverging from the global solution. We demonstrate that individual client models
  experience a catastrophic forgetting with respect to data from other clients and
  propose an efficient approach that modifies the cross-entropy objective on a per-client
  basis by re-weighting the softmax logits prior to computing the loss. This approach
  shields classes outside a clientâ€™s label set from abrupt representation change and
  we empirically demonstrate it can alleviate client forgetting and provide consistent
  improvements to standard federated learning algorithms. Our method is particularly
  beneficial under the most challenging federated learning settings where data heterogeneity
  is high and client participation in each round is low.

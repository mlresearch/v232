title: Introspective Action Advising for Interpretable Transfer Learning
abstract: 'Transfer learning can be applied in deep reinforcement learning to accelerate
  the training of a policy in a target task by transferring knowledge from a policy
  learned in a related source task. This is commonly achieved by copying pretrained
  weights from the source policy to the target policy prior to training, under the
  constraint that they use the same model architecture. However, not only does this
  require a robust representation learned over a wide distribution of states – often
  failing to transfer between specialist models trained over single tasks – but it
  is largely uninterpretable and provides little indication of what knowledge is transferred.
  In this work, we propose an alternative approach to transfer learning between tasks
  based on action advising, in which a teacher trained in a source task actively guides
  a student’s exploration in a target task. Through introspection, the teacher is
  capable of identifying when advice is beneficial to the student and should be given,
  and when it is not. Our approach allows knowledge transfer between policies agnostic
  of the underlying representations, and we empirically show that this leads to improved
  convergence rates in Gridworld and Atari environments while providing insight into
  what knowledge is transferred.  '

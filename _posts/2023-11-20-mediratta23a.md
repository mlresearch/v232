title: Stabilizing Unsupervised Environment Design with a Learned Adversary
abstract: A key challenge in training generally-capable agents is the design of training
  tasks that facilitate broad generalization and robustness to environment variations.
  This challenge motivates the problem setting of \emph{Unsupervised Environment Design}
  (UED), whereby a student agent trains on an adaptive distribution of tasks proposed
  by a teacher agent. A pioneering approach for UED is PAIRED, which uses reinforcement
  learning (RL) to train a teacher policy to design tasks from scratch, making it
  possible to directly generate tasks that are adapted to the agent’s current capabilities.
  Despite its strong theoretical backing, PAIRED suffers from a variety of challenges
  that hinder its practical performance. Thus, state-of-the-art methods currently
  rely on \emph{curation} and \emph{mutation} rather than \emph{generation} of new
  tasks. In this work, we investigate several key shortcomings of PAIRED and propose
  solutions for each shortcoming. As a result, we make it possible for PAIRED to match
  or exceed state-of-the-art methods, producing robust agents in several challenging
  procedurally-generated environments, including a partially-observed maze navigation
  task and a continuous-control car racing environment. We believe this work motivates
  a renewed emphasis on UED methods based on learned models that directly generate
  challenging environments, potentially unlocking more open-ended RL training and,
  as a result, more general agents.

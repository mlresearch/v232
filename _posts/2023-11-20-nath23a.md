title: Sharing Lifelong Reinforcement Learning Knowledge via Modulating Masks
abstract: Lifelong learning agents aim to learn multiple tasks sequentially over a
  lifetime. This involves the ability to exploit previous knowledge when learning
  new tasks and to avoid forgetting. Recently, modulating masks, a specific type of
  parameter isolation approach, have shown promise in both supervised and reinforcement
  learning. While lifelong learning algorithms have been investigated mainly within
  a single-agent approach, a question remains on how multiple agents can share lifelong
  learning knowledge with each other. We show that the parameter isolation mechanism
  used by modulating masks is particularly suitable for exchanging knowledge among
  agents in a distributed and decentralized system of lifelong learners. The key idea
  is that isolating specific task knowledge to specific masks allows agents to transfer
  only specific knowledge on-demand, resulting in a robust and effective collective
  of agents.  We assume fully distributed and asynchronous scenarios with dynamic
  agent numbers and connectivity. An on-demand communication protocol ensures agents
  query their peers for specific masks to be transferred and integrated into their
  policies when facing each task. Experiments indicate that on-demand mask communication
  is an effective way to implement distributed and decentralized lifelong reinforcement
  learning, and provides a lifelong learning benefit with respect to distributed RL
  baselines such as DD-PPO, IMPALA, and PPO+EWC. The system is particularly robust
  to connection drops and demonstrates rapid learning due to knowledge exchange.

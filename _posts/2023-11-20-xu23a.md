title: Model-Based Meta Automatic Curriculum Learning
abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) has been widely explored to facilitate the learning
  of hard-exploration tasks in reinforcement learning (RL) by training a sequence
  of easier tasks, often called a curriculum. While most curricula are built either
  manually or automatically based on heuristics, e.g. choosing a training task which
  is barely beyond the current abilities of the learner, the fact that similar tasks
  might benefit from similar curricula motivates us to explore meta-learning as a
  technique for curriculum generation or teaching for a distribution of similar tasks.
  This paper formulates the meta CL problem that requires a meta-teacher to generate
  the curriculum which will assist the student to train toward any given target task
  from a task distribution based on the similarity of these tasks to one another.
  We propose a model-based meta automatic curriculum learning algorithm (MM-ACL) that
  learns to predict the performance improvement on one task when the student is trained
  on another, given the current status of the student. This predictor can then be
  used to generate the curricula for different target tasks. Our empirical results
  demonstrate that MM-ACL outperforms the state-of-the-art CL algorithms in a grid-world
  domain and a more complex visual-based navigation domain in terms of sample efficiency.

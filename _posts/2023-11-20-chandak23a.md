title: Differentially Private Algorithms for Efficient Online Matroid Optimization
abstract: A matroid bandit is the online version of combinatorial optimization on
  a matroid, in which the learner chooses $K$ actions from a set of $L$ actions that
  can form a matroid basis. Many real-world applications such as recommendation systems
  can be modeled as matroid bandits. In such learning problems, the revealed data
  may involve sensitive user information. Therefore, privacy considerations are crucial.
  We propose two simple and practical differentially private algorithms for matroid
  bandits built upon the ideas of Upper Confidence Bound and Thompson Sampling. The
  key idea behind our first algorithm, Differentially Private Upper Confidence Bound
  for Matroid Bandits (DPUCB-MAT), is to construct differentially private upper confidence
  bounds. The second algorithm, Differentially Private Thompson Sampling for Matroid
  Bandits (DPTS-MAT), is based on the idea of drawing random samples from differentially
  private posterior distributions. Both algorithms achieve $O\left( L\ln(n)/\Delta
  + LK\ln(n) \min\left\{K, \ln(n) \right\}/\varepsilon \right)$ regret bounds, where
  $\Delta$ denotes the mean reward gap and $\varepsilon$ is the required privacy parameter.
  Our derived regret bounds rely on novel technical arguments that deeply explore
  the special structure of matroids. We show a novel way to construct ordered pairs
  between the played actions and the optimal actions, which contributes to decomposing
  a matroid bandit problem into $K$ stochastic multi-armed bandit problems. Finally,
  we conduct experiments to demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed
  learning algorithms by using both synthetic and real-world movie-recommendation
  datasets.

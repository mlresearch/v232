title: Improving Performance in Continual Learning Tasks using Bio-Inspired Architectures
abstract: The ability to learn continuously from an incoming data stream without catastrophic
  forgetting is critical to designing intelligent systems. Many approaches to continual
  learning rely on stochastic gradient descent and its variants that employ global
  error updates, and hence need to adopt strategies such as memory buffers or replay
  to circumvent its stability, greed, and short-term memory limitations. To address
  this limitation, we have developed a biologically inspired lightweight neural network
  architecture that incorporates synaptic plasticity mechanisms and neuromodulation
  and hence learns through local error signals to enable online continual learning
  without stochastic gradient descent. Our approach leads to superior online continual
  learning performance on Split-MNIST, Split-CIFAR-10, and Split-CIFAR-100 datasets
  compared to other memory-constrained learning approaches and matches that of the
  state-of-the-art memory-intensive replay-based approaches. We further demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach by integrating key design concepts into other
  backpropagation-based continual learning algorithms, significantly improving their
  accuracy. Our results provide compelling evidence for the importance of incorporating
  biological principles into machine learning models and offer insights into how we
  can leverage them to design more efficient and robust systems for online continual
  learning.

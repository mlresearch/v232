title: Substituting Data Annotation with Balanced Neighbourhoods and Collective Loss
  in Multi-label Text Classification
abstract: 'Multi-label text classification (MLTC) is the task of assigning multiple
  labels to a given text, and has a wide range of application domains. Most existing
  approaches require an enormous amount of annotated data to learn a classifier and/or
  a set of well-defined constraints on the label space structure, such as hierarchical
  relations which may be complicated to provide as the number of labels increases.  In
  this paper, we study the MLTC problem in annotation-free and scarce-annotation settings
  in which the magnitude of available supervision signals is linear to the number
  of labels.  Our method follows three steps, (1) mapping input text into a set of
  preliminary label likelihoods by natural language inference using a pre-trained
  language model, (2) calculating a signed label dependency graph by label descriptions,
  and (3) updating the preliminary label likelihoods with message passing along the
  label dependency graph, driven with a collective loss function that injects the
  information of expected label frequency and average multi-label cardinality of predictions.
  The experiments show that the proposed framework achieves effective performance
  under low supervision settings with almost imperceptible computational and memory
  overheads added to the usage of pre-trained language model outperforming its initial
  performance by 70% in terms of example-based F1 score. '

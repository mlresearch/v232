title: Autotelic Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Agent Environments
abstract: " In the intrinsically motivated skills acquisition problem, the agent is
  set in an environment with- out any pre-defined goals and needs to acquire an open-ended
  repertoire of skills. To do so the agent needs to be autotelic (deriving from the
  Greek auto (self) and telos (end goal)): it needs to generate goals and learn to
  achieve them following its own intrinsic motivation rather than external supervision.
  Autotelic agents have so far been considered in isolation. But many applications
  of open-ended learning entail groups of agents. Multi-agent environments pose an
  additional challenge for autotelic agents: to discover and master goals that require
  cooperation agents must pursue them simultaneously, but they have low chances of
  doing so if they sample them independently. In this work, we propose a new learning
  paradigm for modelling such settings, the Decentralized Intrinsically Motivated
  Skills Acquisition Problem (Dec-IMSAP), and employ it to solve cooperative navigation
  tasks. First, we show that agents setting their goals independently fail to master
  the full diversity of goals. Then, we show that a sufficient condition for achieving
  this is to ensure that a group aligns its goals, i.e., the agents pursue the same
  cooperative goal. Our empirical analysis shows that alignment enables specialization,
  an efficient strategy for cooperation. Finally, we intro- duce the Goal-coordination
  game, a fully-decentralized emergent communication algorithm, where goal alignment
  emerges from the maximization of individual rewards in multi-goal cooperative environments
  and show that it is able to reach equal performance to a centralized training baseline
  that guarantees aligned goals. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution
  addressing the problem of intrinsically motivated multi-agent goal exploration in
  a decentralized training paradigm."

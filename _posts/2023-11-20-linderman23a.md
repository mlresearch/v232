title: Fine-grain Inference on Out-of-Distribution Data with Hierarchical Classification
abstract: Machine learning methods must be trusted to make appropriate decisions in
  real-world environments, even when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples.
  Many current approaches simply aim to detect OOD examples and alert the user when
  an unrecognized input is given. However, when the OOD sample significantly overlaps
  with the training data, a binary anomaly detection is not interpretable or explainable,
  and provides little information to the user. We propose a new model for OOD detection
  that makes predictions at varying levels of granularity—as the inputs become more
  ambiguous, the model predictions become coarser and more conservative. Consider
  an animal classifier that encounters an unknown bird species and a car. Both cases
  are OOD, but the user gains more information if the classifier recognizes that its
  uncertainty over the particular species is too large and predicts “bird” instead
  of detecting it as OOD. Furthermore, we diagnose the classifier’s performance at
  each level of the hierarchy improving the explainability and interpretability of
  the model’s predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical classifiers
  for both fine- and coarse-grained OOD tasks.

title: Loss of Plasticity in Continual Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: In this paper, we characterize the behavior of canonical value-based deep
  reinforcement learning (RL) approaches under varying degrees of non-stationarity.
  In particular, we demonstrate that deep RL agents lose their ability to learn good
  policies when they cycle through a sequence of Atari 2600 games. This phenomenon
  is alluded to in prior work under various guises—e.g., loss of plasticity, implicit
  under-parameterization, primacy bias, and capacity loss. We investigate this phenomenon
  closely at scale and analyze how the weights, gradients, and activations change
  over time in several experiments with varying experimental conditions (e.g., similarity
  between games, number of games, number of frames per game). Our analysis shows that
  the activation footprint of the network becomes sparser, contributing to the diminishing
  gradients. We investigate a remarkably simple mitigation strategy—Concatenated ReLUs
  (CReLUs) activation function—and demonstrate its effectiveness in facilitating continual
  learning in a changing environment.

title: 'Time and temporal abstraction in continual learning: tradeoffs, analogies
  and regret in an active measuring setting'
abstract: This conceptual paper provides theoretical results linking notions in semi-supervised
  learning (SSL) and hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) in the context of lifelong
  learning. Specifically, our construction sets up a direct analogy between intermediate
  representations in SSL and temporal abstraction in RL, highlighting the important
  role of factorization in both types of hierarchy and the relevance of partial labeling,
  resp. partial observation. The construction centres around a simple class of Partially
  Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) where we show tools and results from
  SSL imply lower bounds on regret holding for any RL algorithm without access to
  temporal abstraction. While our lower bound is for a restricted class of RL problems,
  it applies to arbitrary RL algorithms in this setting. The setting moreover features
  so-called “active measuring”, an aspect of widespread relevance in industrial control,
  but - possibly due to its lifelong learning flavour - not yet well-studied in RL.
  Our formalization makes it possible to think about tradeoffs that apply for such
  control problems.

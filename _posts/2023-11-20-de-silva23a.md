title: 'Prospective Learning: Principled Extrapolation to the Future'
abstract: Learning is a process which can update decision rules, based on past experience,
  such that future performance improves. Traditionally, machine learning is often
  evaluated under the assumption that the future will be identical to the past in
  distribution or change adversarially. But these assumptions can be either too optimistic
  or pessimistic for many problems in the real world. Real world scenarios evolve
  over multiple spatiotemporal scales with partially predictable dynamics. Here we
  reformulate the learning problem to one that centers around this idea of dynamic
  futures that are partially learnable. We conjecture that certain sequences of tasks
  are not retrospectively learnable (in which the data distribution is fixed), but
  are prospectively learnable (in which distributions may be dynamic), suggesting
  that prospective learning is more difficult in kind than retrospective learning.
  We argue that prospective learning more accurately characterizes many real world
  problems that (1) currently stymie existing artificial intelligence solutions and/or
  (2) lack adequate explanations for how natural intelligences solve them. Thus, studying
  prospective learning will lead to deeper insights and solutions to currently vexing
  challenges in both natural and artificial intelligences.

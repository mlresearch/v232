title: 'Task-Agnostic Continual Reinforcement Learning: Gaining Insights and Overcoming
  Challenges'
abstract: 'Continual learning (CL) enables the development of models and agents that
  learn from a sequence of tasks while addressing the limitations of standard deep
  learning approaches, such as catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we investigate
  the factors that contribute to the performance differences between task-agnostic
  CL and multi-task (MTL) agents. We pose two hypotheses: (1) task-agnostic methods
  might provide advantages in settings with limited data, computation, or high dimensionality,
  and (2) faster adaptation may be particularly beneficial in continual learning settings,
  helping to mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting. To investigate these
  hypotheses, we introduce a replay-based recurrent reinforcement learning (3RL) methodology
  for task-agnostic CL agents. We assess 3RL on a synthetic task and the Meta-World
  benchmark, which includes 50 unique manipulation tasks. Our results demonstrate
  that 3RL outperforms baseline methods and can even surpass its multi-task equivalent
  in challenging settings with high dimensionality. We also show that the recurrent
  task-agnostic agent consistently outperforms or matches the performance of its transformer-based
  counterpart.  These findings provide insights into the advantages of task-agnostic
  CL over task-aware MTL approaches and highlight the potential of task-agnostic methods
  in resource-constrained, high-dimensional, and multi-task environments.'

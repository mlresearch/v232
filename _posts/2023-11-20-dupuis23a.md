title: 'VIBR: Learning View-Invariant Value Functions for Robust Visual Control'
abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning on images showed significant progress
  in the recent years. Data-based approach leverage data augmentation and domain randomization
  while representation learning methods use auxiliary losses to learn task-relevant
  features. Yet, reinforcement still struggles in visually diverse environments full
  of distractions and spurious noise. In this work, we tackle the problem of robust
  visual control at its core and present VIBR (View-Invariant Bellman Residuals),
  a method that combines multi-view training and invariant prediction to reduce out-of-distribution
  (OOD) generalization gap for RL based visuomotor control. Our model-free approach
  improve baselines performances without the need of additional representation learning
  objectives and with limited additional computational cost. We show that VIBR outperforms
  existing methods on complex visuo-motor control environment with high visual perturbation.
  Our approach achieves state-of the-art results on the Distracting Control Suite
  benchmark, a challenging benchmark still not solved by current methods, where we
  evaluate the robustness to a number of visual perturbators, as well as OOD generalization
  and extrapolation capabilities.

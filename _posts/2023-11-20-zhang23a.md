title: Learning Meta Representations for Agents in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the behaviors that agents learn in
  a single Markov Game (MG) are typically confined to the given agent number. Every
  single MG induced by varying the population may possess distinct optimal joint strategies
  and game-specific knowledge, which are modeled independently in modern multi-agent
  reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work, our focus is on creating agents
  that can generalize across population-varying MGs. Instead of learning a unimodal
  policy, each agent learns a policy set comprising effective strategies across a
  variety of games. To achieve this, we propose Meta Representations for Agents (MRA)
  that explicitly models the game-common and game-specific strategic knowledge. By
  representing the policy sets with multi-modal latent policies, the game-common strategic
  knowledge and diverse strategic modes are discovered through an iterative optimization
  procedure. We prove that by approximately maximizing the resulting constrained mutual
  information objective, the policies can reach Nash Equilibrium in every evaluation
  MG when the latent space is sufficiently large. When deploying MRA in practical
  settings with limited latent space sizes, fast adaptation can be achieved by leveraging
  the first-order gradient information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
  of MRA in improving training performance and generalization ability in challenging
  evaluation games.

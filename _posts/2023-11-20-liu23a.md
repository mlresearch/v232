title: Measuring and Mitigating Interference in Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Catastrophic interference is common in many network-based learning systems,
  and many proposals exist for mitigating it. Before overcoming interference we must
  understand it better. In this work, we provide a definition and novel measure of
  interference for value-based reinforcement learning methods such as Fitted Q-Iteration
  and DQN. We systematically evaluate our measure of interference, showing that it
  correlates with instability in control performance, across a variety of network
  architectures. Our new interference measure allows us to ask novel scientific questions
  about commonly used deep learning architectures and study learning algorithms which
  mitigate interference. Lastly, we outline a class of algorithms which we call online-aware
  that are designed to mitigate interference, and show they do reduce interference
  according to our measure and that they improve stability and performance in several
  classic control environments.

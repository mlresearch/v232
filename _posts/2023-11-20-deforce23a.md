title: 'MultiMix TFT: A Multi-task Mixed-Frequency Framework with Temporal Fusion
  Transformers'
abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has been increasingly recognized as an effective
  paradigm in time-series analysis for forecasting multiple related tasks concurrently.
  Prior MTL frameworks for time-series forecasting have typically been devised for
  tasks that share the same regular time frequencies. However, numerous real-world
  scenarios entail tasks measured at mixed, and often irregular, time frequencies.
  We propose a multi-task mixed-frequency (MultiMix) learning framework for time-series
  forecasting that addresses the challenges of mixed-frequency scenarios where tasks
  are measured at different and/or irregular time intervals. Our proposed framework
  leverages the relationships between mixed-frequency tasks to improve accuracy and
  robustness of time-series forecasting across tasks. The MultiMix framework is implemented
  using the state-of-the-art Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and is evaluated in
  smart irrigation, where predicting mid-day stem water potential and soil water potential
  pose critical challenges. The MultiMix TFT enables joint forecasting of stem water
  potential, measured sparsely on irregular and infrequent time intervals, and soil
  water potential, measured on a daily time interval. The results show substantial
  improvements in stem water potential prediction over state-of-the-art baselines
  while achieving comparable performance for soil water potential. These results confirm
  the effectiveness of the proposed framework for addressing the mixed-frequency time-series
  forecasting problem in real-world settings. Code will be made available upon publication.

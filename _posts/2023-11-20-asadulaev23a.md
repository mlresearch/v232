title: A Minimalist Approach for Domain Adaptation with Optimal Transport
abstract: We reveal an intriguing connection between adversarial attacks and cycle
  monotone maps, also known as optimal transport maps. Based on this finding, we developed
  a novel method named \textit{source fiction} for semi-supervised optimal transport-based
  domain adaptation. We conduct experiments on various datasets and show that our
  method can notably improve the performance of the optimal transport solvers in domain
  adaptation.

title: Fixed Design Analysis of Regularization-Based Continual Learning
abstract: 'We consider a continual learning (CL) problem with two linear regression
  tasks in the fixed design setting, where the feature vectors are assumed fixed and
  the labels are assumed to be random variables. We consider an $\ell_2$-regularized
  CL algorithm, which computes an Ordinary Least Squares parameter to fit the first
  dataset, then computes another parameter that fits the second dataset under an $\ell_2$-regularization
  penalizing its deviation from the first parameter, and outputs the second parameter.
  For this algorithm, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the average risk
  over the two tasks. Our risk bounds reveal a provable trade-off between forgetting
  and intransigence of the $\ell_2$-regularized CL algorithm: with a large regularization
  parameter, the algorithm output forgets less information about the first task but
  is intransigent to extract new information from the second task; and vice versa.
  Our results suggest that catastrophic forgetting could happen for CL with dissimilar
  tasks (under a precise similarity measurement), and that a well-tuned $\ell_2$-regularization
  can partially mitigate this issue by introducing intransigence.'

title: 'SF-FSDA: Source-Free Few-Shot Domain Adaptive Object Detection with Efficient
  Labeled Data Factory'
abstract: Domain adaptive object detection aims to leverage the knowledge learned
  from a labeled source domain to improve the performance on an unlabeled target domain.
  Prior works typically require the access to the source domain data for adaptation,
  and the availability of sufficient data on the target domain. However, these assumptions
  may not hold due to data privacy and rare data collection. In this paper, we propose
  and investigate a more practical and challenging domain adaptive object detection
  problem under both source-free and few-shot conditions, named as SF-FSDA. To overcome
  this problem, we develop an efficient labeled data factory based approach. Without
  accessing the source domain, the data factory renders i) infinite amount of synthesized
  target-domain like images, under the guidance of the few-shot image samples and
  text description from the target domain; ii) corresponding bounding box and category
  annotations, only demanding minimum human effort, i.e., a few manually labeled examples.
  On the one hand, the synthesized images mitigate the knowledge insufficiency brought
  by the few-shot condition. On the other hand, compared to the popular pseudo-label
  technique, the generated annotations from data factory not only get rid of the reliance
  on the source pretrained object detection model, but also alleviate the unavoidably
  pseudo-label noise due to domain shift and source-free condition. The generated
  dataset is further utilized to adapt the source pretrained object detection model,
  realizing the robust object detection under SF-FSDA. The experiments on different
  settings showcase that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art
  methods on SF-FSDA problem. Our codes and models will be made publicly available.

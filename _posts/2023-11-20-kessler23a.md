title: The Effectiveness of World Models for Continual Reinforcement Learning
abstract: World models power some of the most efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.
  In this work, we showcase that they can be harnessed for continual learning – a
  situation when the agent faces changing environments. World models typically employ
  a replay buffer for training, which can be naturally extended to continual learning.
  We systematically study how different selective experience replay methods affect
  performance, forgetting, and transfer. We also provide recommendations regarding
  various modeling options for using world models. The best set of choices is called
  Continual-Dreamer, it is task-agnostic and utilizes the world model for continual
  exploration. Continual-Dreamer is sample efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art
  task-agnostic continual reinforcement learning methods on Minigrid and Minihack
  benchmarks.

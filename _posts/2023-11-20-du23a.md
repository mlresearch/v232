title: 'EMO: Episodic Memory Optimization for Few-Shot Meta-Learning'
abstract: Few-shot meta-learning presents a challenge for gradient descent optimization
  due to the limited number of training samples per task. To address this issue, we
  propose an episodic memory optimization for meta-learning, we call EMO, which is
  inspired by the human ability to recall past learning experiences from the brainâ€™s
  memory. EMO retains the gradient history of past experienced tasks in external memory,
  enabling few-shot learning in a memory-augmented way. By learning to retain and
  recall the learning process of past training tasks, EMO nudges parameter updates
  in the right direction, even when the gradients provided by a limited number of
  examples are uninformative. We prove theoretically that our algorithm converges
  for smooth, strongly convex objectives. EMO is generic, flexible, and model-agnostic,
  making it a simple plug-and-play optimizer that can be seamlessly embedded into
  existing optimization-based few-shot meta-learning approaches. Empirical results
  show that EMO scales well with most few-shot classification benchmarks and improves
  the performance of optimization-based meta-learning methods, resulting in accelerated
  convergence.

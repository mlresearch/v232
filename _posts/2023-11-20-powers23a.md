title: Evaluating Continual Learning on a Home Robot
abstract: Robots in home environments need to be able to learn new skills continuously
  as data becomes available, becoming ever more capable over time while using as little
  real-world data as possible. However, traditional robot learning approaches typically
  assume large amounts of iid data, which is inconsistent with this goal. In contrast,
  continuous learning methods like CLEAR and SANE allow autonomous agents to learn
  off of a stream of non-iid samples; they, however, have not previously been demonstrated
  on real robotics platforms. In this work, we show how continuous learning methods
  can be adapted for use on a real, low-cost home robot, and in particular look at
  the case where we have extremely small numbers of examples, in a task-id-free setting.
  Specifically, we propose SANER, a method for continuously learning a library of
  skills, and \model{} (Attention-Based PointNet) as the backbone to support it. We
  learn four sequential kitchen tasks on a low-cost home robot, using only a handful
  of demonstrations per task.
